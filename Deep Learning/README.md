This folder contains my deep learning projects, experiments, and research. It includes implementations of key models and techniques in computer vision, natural language processing, and neural networks using frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. The goal is to build hands-on expertise and develop a strong foundation in deep learning through practical applications and custom model building.
